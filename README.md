<!-- Prototyping -->
<img src="./readme/title3.svg"/>

> We designed Predicode using wireframes and mockups, iterating on the design until we reached the ideal layout for easy navigation and a seamless user experience.

### Wireframes

<!-- Tech stack -->

### Predicode is built using the following technologies:

- This project uses the [Vite Next Generation Frontend Tooling](https://vitejs.dev/). Vite is a fast and efficient build tool and web development platform that simplifies the creation of modern and scalable web applications. It offers fast module reloading, supports popular front-end frameworks, and optimizes the build process for performance.
- With Vite we are using [React Js](https://react.dev/) a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces, and it works seamlessly with Vite.
- For fast and scalable API development (backend), the website use [FastAPI framework](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/). FastAPI is a modern, fast (high-performance), web framework for building APIs with Python 3.7+ based on standard Python type hints.
- For Efficient ML experimentation environment with visualization capabilities. We used [JupyterLab: A Next-Generation Notebook Interface](https://jupyter.org/). JupyterLab is the latest web-based interactive development environment for notebooks, code, and data. Its flexible interface allows users to configure and arrange workflows in data science, scientific computing, computational journalism, and machine learning. A modular design invites extensions to expand and enrich functionality.
- To develop our Machine Learning model, we used [Scikit-learn random forest regressor](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/index.html#). scikit-learn is a Python machine learning library with easy-to-use algorithms and tools for data preprocessing modeling, and evaluation.
- To optimize this model, we used [Distributed Evolutionary Algorithms in Python](https://github.com/deap/deap). DEAP is a Python library for implementing evolutionary algorithms for optimization tasks, with tools for parallelization and visualization.
- For persistent storage (database), the website uses the [Mongodb](https://www.mongodb.com/) package which allows the app to create a custom storage schema and save it to a local database.
- The app is [Dockerized](https://www.docker.com/) . Docker takes away repetitive, mundane configuration tasks and is used throughout the development lifecycle for fast, easy and portable application development â€“ desktop and cloud.
- The app uses the font ["Montserrat"](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Montserrat) as its main font, and the design of the app adheres to the material design guidelines.

<!-- How to run -->
<img src="./readme/title6.svg"/>

> To set up Predicode locally, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

Those are the prerequisites before installing the project

- npm

  ```sh
  npm install npm@latest -g
  ```

- Python

1. Open the official Python website https://www.python.org/downloads/
2. Scroll down to find the latest version of Python and download the installer package
3. Double-click the downloaded package file to launch the installer.
4. Follow the instructions in the installer to complete the installation process.

- MongoDB

  -For Mac

1. Download the MongoDB Community Server .tgz file from the official website: https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community.
2. Open the downloaded .tgz file and extract the contents to a desired location.
3. Rename the extracted folder to mongodb.
4. Move the mongodb folder to the root directory (i.e., /) or to another preferred location.
5. dd MongoDB's binaries to the system path by adding the following line to your ~/.bash_profile file:

```sh
export PATH=<mongodb-install-directory>/bin:$PATH
```

6. Run the mongod command in a terminal window to start the MongoDB server.

For Windows

1. Download the MongoDB Community Server .msi file from the official website: https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community.
2. Run the downloaded .msi file and follow the installation wizard.
3. Choose a custom installation location or keep the default location suggested by the installer.
4. Choose to install MongoDB as a service or not. Installing as a service allows MongoDB to start automatically when the computer starts.
5. Complete the installation by clicking the "Install" button.
6. Open a Command Prompt window and navigate to the bin folder of the MongoDB installation directory.
7. Run the mongod command in the Command Prompt window to start the MongoDB server.

### Installation

   cd predicode-server
   ```
7. Create a virtual environment
   ```sh
   python3 -m venv my_venv
   ```
8. Deactivate virtual environment if you're in one
   ```sh
   deactivate
   ```
   OR, if you were in an anaconda virtual environment
   ```sh
   conda deactivate
   ```
9. Activate your virtual environement
   ```sh
   source my_venv/bin/activate
   ```
10. Install the requirements
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
11. In the app directory in the configs folder create a new file named 'config.py' and copy config_example into it and fill it with your configuration
12. For the OPEN_AI_KEY go to https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys, create an account and get your key.
13. In the public directory create a folder named "profile_pictures"
14. Go to the app directory
    ```sh
    cd app
    ```
15. Run the app
    ```sh
    uvicorn main:app --reload
    ```

Now, you should be able to run Predicode locally and explore its features.
